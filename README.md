# musclenerd (WIP)
Workout program builder / analyser. Live preview [here](https://dylanrjohnston.github.io/musclenerd/).

## Why
I was trying to write a new high frequency workout plan which needs to carefully balance volume and frequency and doing this by hand was very tedious, I also wanted to learn how to write a drag and drop interface in react.
